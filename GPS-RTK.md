Basic principal of GPS-RTK.
  RTK(Real Time Kinematic) is a technology to enhance acurracy of GNSS system.
  It uses measurements of the phase of GPS signal's carrier wave, not the informational content of the signal.
  Theoretically, accuracy of RTK system could reach 2mm.
  
Why is technology like GPS-RTK is needed?
  Because with conventional way, loaction accuracy can only be around 3m('civialian' code) to 30cm('military' code).
  
How does GPS-RTK work?
  GPS-RTK works based on Carrier-wave-tracking. This method uses carrier wave to calculate distance between satalites and the point where user is. 
  
  
  
  
Q1. why does NTRIP require users ID/PW to 'listen' to their broadcast?
